        My name is Marigona.  <br /><br/>   I am a Senior Front-End Developer with over five years of experience designing, building, and optimizing responsive web applications. Having spent seven years in retail management, where ERP systems played a key role in sales and operations, I naturally transitioned into the development of such systems. My first-hand experience using ERP tools gave me a deep understanding of user needs, allowing me to build more intuitive, efficient, and user-friendly software by customizing interfaces, improving usability, and refining best practice guidelines.

        <p className="text-xl">



          Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to collaborate with teams across the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden, Albania and Kosovo, delivering high-quality solutions while adapting to different markets and user needs.

          I specialize in building modern, scalable applications from scratch, creating seamless user experiences for AI-driven speech-to-text platforms, human transcription services, e-commerce solutions, and complex dashboards. My work also includes payment integrations and large-scale grid frameworks for structured content management.

          I value clean, minimalistic design, thoughtful branding, and user-centric experiences that drive engagement and conversions. Whether refining an existing platform or crafting a distinct digital identity, I prioritize performance, accessibility, and long-term scalability.
<br/><br/>
          As a freelancer, I provide flexibility and availability for urgent issues, last-minute meetings, and time-sensitive requests, ensuring projects run smoothly and efficiently. Adapted to shifting priorities and fast-paced environments, helping clients stay productive and on track.

          Passionate about solving complex challenges, I collaborate directly with client from concept to launch, ensuring efficiency, usability, and impact.
<br/><br/>
            Let's build solutions that drive results!
